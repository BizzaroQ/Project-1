This project was tricky. The programming itself wasn't a big issue. 
Our team was able to work through a few ways of completing the task. 
The trouble arose out of our team dynamic. As the leader I spent too
much time worrying about where our new team member, Christopher McMahon
was. That worry made me indisicive and set us behind to see if the new team
member would show up. I tasked myself with writing the Person class so I could focus on
understanding how our team members interacted. 

In terms of the Person object, I did now do much in terms of optimizing. The
only change I made was to add a child to each parent when the parent is assigned. 
I also peer reviewed code so our individually assigned methods worked together. 
Additionally, I full commented the code.

Over all, I appreciate the drive for cooperation between team members as well as the drive to 
understand eachothers work.
