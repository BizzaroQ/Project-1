My team project parts are treeMaker, getPerson, and addRelatives. 
TreeMaker method constructs an ArrayList of family relationship 
from the second portion of the file, “tudor.dat”. ArrayList is 
using for-each loop to set every three persons in file as a family 
relationship and set first people is the child in their family, 
second people be the mother of their family and last one is the 
father. And calling the addRelatives method in the end of the loop. 
By calling the addRelatives method, the system can find the parent 
relationship to the person who is called, help program to find the 
children for the name called. GetPerson method returns the person’s
name when system find the name called, otherwise return a new Person 
instantiated with name.
